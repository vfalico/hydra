Some definitions (if one uses qemu-kvm x86_64, wasn't tested on anything
else yet):
Host: Where QEMU VM is started
BSP: The QEMU kernel
AP: The kernel that is started second inside QEMU.

Host (building the kernels mainly):
cd src/hydra_scripts
./prepare.sh

BSP (installing the BSP kernel, rebooting and starting the AP):
cd src
make modules_install install
reboot
cd src/hydra_scripts
./start_ap.sh

There should be some output on serial0, and one should be able to telnet
into the AP via 10.1.2.2.

Qemu command line used:
sudo qemu-kvm -m 4096 -drive file=<hdd image>,if=virtio \
-netdev type=tap,script=<ifup script>,downscript=no,id=net0 \
-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
-smp 4 -name hydra -virtfs
local,path=<src directory>,mount_tag=src,security_model=none \
-serial vc \
$@

It also permits to mount the src dir transparently in the VM, using 9p.
